# How to draw

Our rend language consists of:
* variable declarations
* loop settings
* statements


## Variable declarations
Variables are single characters. They are defined as `x=(expressions)`. Multiple varibles can be defined with a comma seperating them.

```
x=100,y=0;
```

## loop settings
Next you define how often you want to paint. `300ms:`

## Statements
Statements end with a semicolon.

### color
Set the paint color with `#websafecolor`, for example `#orange;`

## rectangle
Use the `r` method for drawing rectangles.

`r x y w h` where x y w h are expressions.


## line
Use the `l` method for drawing rectangles.

`r ax ay bx by` where ax ay bx by are expressions.
